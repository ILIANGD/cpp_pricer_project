C++ princing description and instructions.

This C++ pricing engine is structured into three core methodologies: the Cox-Ross-Rubinstein (CRR) binomial model for discrete time valuation, the Black-Scholes model for continuous time analytical solutions, and a stochastic Monte Carlo simulation
By building these three models, I was able to cross reference my results and truly master the subtle differences between discrete, continuous, and stochastic pricing methods.
